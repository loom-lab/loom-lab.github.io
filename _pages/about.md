The _Locally Owned & Managed_ Systems (LOOM) Lab focuses on research at the context of computer networked systems and people--a spece we refer to as **human-centered networks**. The lab is directed by Dr. Morgan Vigil-Hayes, currently an associate professor in the [Media & Information Department](https://comartsci.msu.edu/departments/media-and-information) at Michigan State University.

Historically, the Vigil-Hayes research group has focused on projects that engage a wide range of human-centered networking topics, including:

* _How do people use networked systems?_
* _How do people create and care for networked systems?_
* _How can designers create tools that help people better utilize and care for networked systems?_

This site hosts select publications and talks given by the research group and shares information about ongoing projects.


Research Mission
=====

_We seek to weave together human-centered design and networked systems research to build and study technologies in ways that are thoughtful, inclusive, and community-informed. We explore how people and infrastructures intersectâ€”(co)designing networked systems that reflect the realities, values, practices, and places of the communities they serve.
Through interdisciplinary collaboration, participatory methods, and responsible systems thinking, we aim to reshape how connectivity is built, experienced, and sustained.
We are particularly committed to working with communities where [rurality](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328487) and Indigeneity are critical to community governance and practice._

**Themes:** _community networks; human-centered networking; digital equity; rurality; Indigeneity; computational futures_

Research Methods
=====

LOOM Labs relies on mixed methods to answer questions about complex sociotechnical systems. These include research through design (RtD), network system design and implementation, network analysis, statistical analysis, participatory action research, and ethnography.

## **Students** :raising_hand:
We are actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students to our lab for a range of positions.  

Students in our group generally bring a combination of technical know-how (system administration or programming), interest in information science, and passion for the human elements that are embedded within and between and around networked systems. We know that not every student will have expertise in all of these areas, but hope to find students who are committed to and aligned with our research mission who are excited about bringing their strengths and curiosity to our research agenda. 

The ideal LOOM student is highly self-motivated to learn new skills independently, committed to rigorous thinking and analysis, and aware of where they need to grow. They are consciencious of how we work together as a team to learn and research. They are willing to develop intercultural communication skills that allow them to think compassionately, critically, and creatively towards digital equity and sovereignty.

You can find a [catalog of active projects here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12D-dNfodxwggWKhqnHu2V2eITqucv0ldEfNz0DwVgPQ/edit?usp=sharing). 

Email Dr. Vigil-Hayes at [vigilhay@msu.edu](mailto:vigilhay@msu.edu?subject=Student+Interest+Lab) with:

* Brief [cover letter](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/how-to-write-an-effective-cover-letter/) introducing yourself and _why your interest in working with the lab aligns with our Research Mission_. It would be helpful to include your goals (learn how to conduct research? learn how to build and/or deploy technology?) and how you think you can contribute to our projects.
* Resume or CV
* Copy of your unofficial transcript



## **Community Partners** :busts_in_silhouette:
We strive for our research to be as community informed and engaged as possible and we welcome community organizations to reach out to:

* Collaborate on answering a community-based research question. We can conduct network performance measurement studies, interviews, technology design sessions--and more. Let's have a conversation!

* Share knowledge about our current projects or general information about the Internet (how it works, how your community can get more engaged in being a steward for local Internet infrastructure, etc.). We have experience leading technical workshops for students as young as K-5 and up through junior college.
